"""Shared GR00T WBC config — joint lists, gain tables, default arm pose.

Imported by both ``unitree_g1_groot_wbc`` (real hardware) and
``unitree_g1_groot_wbc_sim`` (MuJoCo + viser + splat camera).  The two
blueprints differ only in module composition (which adapter, whether
the viser viewer + splat camera modules are wired) and in the arming
defaults that match each mode's safety needs; everything that's
genuinely identical (gain tables, joint ordering, the trained-pose
zero offset) lives here.
