"""G1 nav sim (MuJoCo) — SimplePlanner + PGO + local obstacle avoidance.

MuJoCo counterpart to ``unitree_g1_nav_sim`` (Unity).  Same nav-stack
composition, same goal-following pipeline; the only difference is the
sim source.  Where the Unity bridge publishes ``registered_scan``,
``odometry``, and ``terrain_map`` directly (ground truth), MuJoCo's G1
connection only publishes raw ``lidar`` and a ``PoseStamped`` pose.  We
bridge the two ports:

- ``lidar`` is already in world frame from the MuJoCo lidar sensor
  process (see ``mujoco_process.py``), so a remap from ``lidar`` →
  ``registered_scan`` is sufficient — no transform needed.
- ``PoseStamped`` is converted to ``nav_msgs/Odometry`` via
  ``MujocoPoseToOdometryAdapter`` (twist fields zeroed; the connection
  doesn't expose linear/angular velocity).
- ``terrain_map`` is computed by ``TerrainAnalysis`` inside
  ``create_nav_stack`` from the registered scan, just like onboard.

Data flow:
    Click → MovementManager → goal → SimplePlanner
    → way_point → LocalPlanner → path → PathFollower
    → nav_cmd_vel → MovementManager → cmd_vel → G1SimConnection (MuJoCo)

    G1SimConnection.lidar (= registered_scan) → TerrainAnalysis → terrain_map
    G1SimConnection.odom → MujocoPoseToOdometryAdapter → odometry → PGO
