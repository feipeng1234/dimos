"""FOPDT forward simulator.

Predicts the output ``y(t)`` of a FOPDT plant driven by an arbitrary
commanded waveform ``cmd(t)``. The fitter (``fopdt.fit_fopdt``) goes the
other direction - data + cmd in, params out. The simulator goes
params + cmd in, predicted data out.

For Rung 2 Session 2 (validation), this is what lets us take params
fitted on forward-direction runs and predict the response on held-out
reverse-direction runs.

Discrete-time first-order with deadtime, integrated on the input
timestamps directly (no resampling - variable-step exact ZOH):

    cmd_delayed(t) = cmd(t - L)              (zero-order hold)
    target(t)     = K * cmd_delayed(t)
    y[k]          = alpha * y[k-1] + (1-alpha) * target[k-1]
    alpha         = exp(-dt / tau)

Using ``target[k-1]`` (the value held over the previous interval) rather
than ``target[k]`` is the exact ZOH discretization of a first-order ODE
under a piecewise-constant input - it matches the analytic step response
at sample times within numerical roundoff.

When ``fall_params`` is provided, ``tau`` (and ``K``, ``L``) switch based
on whether the system is accelerating (``|target| >= |y|``) or braking
(``|target| < |y|``). This mirrors how ``per_run.fit_run`` fits two
FOPDTs per run (one rise = accel, one fall = brake) - the simulator can
replay both edges with their own dynamics. The accel/brake formulation
(rather than ``target >= y``) is what makes this work for reverse-direction
steps where ``target`` is negative throughout.

    Parameters
    ----------
    t : (N,) array
        Timestamps. Need not be uniform; the integrator uses each pair's
        ``dt = t[k] - t[k-1]`` directly.
    cmd : (N,) array
        Commanded value at each timestamp.
    params : FopdtParams
        Model parameters. Used unconditionally when ``fall_params`` is
        None; otherwise used when the system is "rising" (target > y).
    fall_params : FopdtParams, optional
        Parameters for the "falling" regime (target < y). When provided,
        the simulator switches per-step based on the sign of
        ``target - y``.
    initial : float, default 0.0
        Initial output ``y[0]``. Set to a non-zero pre-step baseline if
        you're predicting from a non-zero starting point.
    pre_cmd : float, default 0.0
        Cmd value to use for ``cmd(t - L)`` when ``t - L`` falls before
        ``t[0]``. Defaults to 0 (the system was at rest before the trace).
