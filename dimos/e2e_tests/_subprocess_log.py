"""Subprocess launcher that streams stdout/stderr line-by-line to a logfile.

The naive `Popen(stdout=open(path, "w"))` pattern relies on the child's stdio
to flush on exit, which Deno (and Python with block-buffered stdout) do not
reliably do under SIGTERM. The result is empty CI logs.

This helper reads `subprocess.PIPE` in a background daemon thread and writes
each line with explicit `flush()` so SIGTERM-killed children still leave their
last few hundred lines on disk.
